Recorder.js
===========

Recorder.js = HTML5 getUserMedia + [Lame.js](https://github.com/zhuker/lamejs) + jQuery

A JavaScript based recording UI component that records and clips microphone input to
samples and encodes the samples to MP3 using Lame.js. Everything is done in the browser
and no backend is needed. The UI component supports localization and resizing.
